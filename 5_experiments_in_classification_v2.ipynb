Note that `A` is the total monthly payment including interest. The interest component of the first monthly payment (`A`) is `r` X `P` and the new principal after the first payment is made would be `P` - `A`. The interest component of the second monthly payment is `r` X (`P` - `A`) and so on.\n",

    "1. If an ML model predicts a loan will be paid on time and it actually is, then this is the overall return that an investor will theoretically earn by funding the loan. This is the cost of a True Negative (`TN`).\n",
    "2. If the ML model predicts the loan will result in a default and the loan is actually paid off on time, then this is the prospective loss incurred by the investor by not funding the loan. Since the investor follows the model's recommendation, and does not provide funding, principal is not lost. However, return was there to be earned - and it wasn't! So, the return is lost. This is the cost of a False Positive (`FP`).\n",
    "3. If the ML model predicts that the loan will be paid off on time and it actually defaults, then the principal is lost. Return was never there to be earned since the loan would have defaulted - it was going to be lost, but the model predicted the opposite. So, the return wasn't lost, but the princpal is. A simplifying assumption is made here: the borrower never made any monthly payments. This is a conservative estimate in the sense that the borrower may make a few of the required monthly payments before defaulting on the loan (when a loan payment is 121 days past due). So, the full principal may not be lost in this case. By assuming the worst case scenario (no payments made), this provides an upper bound on the funds that could be lost by a prospective investor. This is an important factor for a conservative investor - the intentend end user of the ML model being developed here. This is the cost of a False Negative (`FN`).\n",
    "4. If the ML model predicts that the loan will result in a default and this does happen, then neither principal nor return are lost. There was no return to be made so return was not lost. Since the investor followed the recommendations of the ML model and did not provide funding, no principal was lost either. This is the cost (or lack thereof) of a True Positive (`TP`).\n",

Each of these is a function of the discrimination threshold - this means the choice of threshold determines the number of false negatives, true positives, etc. predicted by the model. `R(t)` also depends on the threshold. When applied to the ML model's prediction of a outcome of a single loan, three of `FN`, `FP`, `TN` and `TP` are 0 and the fourth value is 1. `P` is the principal for the loan in question and A<sub>t</sub> is the theoretical return (total of all the monthly payments) that could be earned or lost and was calculated above.

    "1. Starting with the best model found from hyper-parameter optimization, extract the columns required to calculate the total of all monthly payments on the loans in the data - these are `int_rate`, `loan_amnt` and `term`. Here, the total of all the monthly payments on a loan (A<sub>t</sub>) is calculated for all loans in the validation split of the data using a helper function `int_income_calculator()` found in `src/business_helpers.py`\n",
    "   - the helper function `int_rate_calculator()` computes the total return on a single loan and it will be vectorized to perform this computation on all the loans in the validation split. This gives a single column of the total return for each loan.\n",
    "2. Why the validation split? Since the best model was already determined during hyper-parameter tuning, it will be re-used. As hyper-parameters were tuned on the training split, the trained (best) model will not be re-trained during threshold tuning. Instead, it will be used to generate the class prediction probabilities for all observations in the validation split.\n",
    "3. A helper function `rowwise_calculate_avg_return_vs_theoretical()` is used to calculate the difference between the ML model's predicted return on a single loan using the formula for `Returns(t)` defined earlier. This functin will use\n",
    "   - predicted probability (converted to a hard label - 0 or 1) and corresponding true value from the validation split\n",

In this table, the ML model predicts the loan is paid off on time and the true outcome is also that the loan is paid off on time. Three of the entries in the confusion matrix will be 0 and the other will be 1 - in the above table, `FP` is 0 and the others are 1. Combining these with the principal (`P`) and total loan income (A<sub>t</sub>), the predicted return can be calculated for the loan. For computing the true return, the predicted class label is represented by the true label (`confusion_matrix(y_true, y_true)`) and the confusion matrix is similarly used.\n",
    "4. The difference between the predicted and true return is then computed and the average differrence across all loans will be used as the `MAE` scoring metric, as explained above, for tuning the discrimination threshold of the ML model."

    "   - a positive difference indicates the average error between the predicted and true return became larger by shuffling (the predicted return is larger than the true return by shuffling)\n",
    "   - a negative difference indicates the average error between predicted and true return became larger in the negative direction by shuffling (the true return is larger than the predicted return by shuffling)\n",
    "2. The `int_rate` (loan's interest rate), `term` (duration of loan) and `loan_amnt` (principal) are required to calculate the interrest income which is used in converting the model's predictions to the per-loan return. By definition, shuffling each of these columns individually will have the greatest affect this conversion. More importantly, the computation of total loan income is not sensible with unrealistic combinations of these three components. So, these three ML features are not used in determining the permutation importance."

Since this is the **average** difference in dollars (horizontal axis) per loan, the marginal value increases in the per-loan return between pairs of features (eg. `annual_inc` vs `purpose`) should also be interpreted as an average rather than a discrete value that can be expected for every single loan."

A single repeat is necessary since dropping the same feature multiple times and re-running the training/prediction gives the same output. So, the boxplot has been replaced by a bar plot.

    "1. Each observation’s prediction is shown as a separate line on this plot. The color of each line is determined as follows: at the top of the plot, each line intersects the horizontal-axis at its predicted value - this is greater than 0.75 for defaulted loans (minority class) and less than 0.75 for loans paid off on-time (majority class) and this value determines the color of the bar on top of the plot.\n",
    "2. The usefulness of the custom base SHAP value is seen in this plot. It allows the predictions to converge at the cutoff value (at the bottom of the plot). Then, moving up the plot, for a single line (i.e. for a single observation), the base value is shifted with no affect on the predicted values.\n",
    "3. Upon moving up the plot for a single line, the SHAP value for each ML feature is added to the base value. The sum of such changes for all features results in the final prediction output of the model - here, this final output is either greater or less than the best discrimination threshold found earlier. In this way, a decision plot shows the contribution of each ML feature to this final prediction for the specific observation (line).\n",

    "Quantifying the output of a predictive classification ML model allows for an customization of ML to the business user. In the case of a conservative investor looking to determine whether or not to fund loans on the Lending Club platform, such an approach allows for estimating the extent of a loss that could result from relying on an ML model-based approach to making such decisions.\n",

    "- the use of built-in or manually specified class weights to account for the significantly larger number of defaulted loans compared to those that were paid on time were used in the best-performing ML models\n",
    "- optimization of the ML model's [discrimination threshold](https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/tag/discrimination-threshold/) based on a case-specific cost function allowed for a better approximation of translating the error in the model's predictions to a dollar cost incurred by the investor (business user)\n",

    "    - takes into acount the approximate dollar value associated with outcome-based scenarios such predicting a loan will be paid back on time when it actually results in a default\n",
    "    - uses the returns (total loan income) to estimate the error of the ML model's predictions and translate hard predictions of the loan outcome into an error metric reflecting the difference in loan income earned by following the ML model predictions and the true outcome of the loan\n",
